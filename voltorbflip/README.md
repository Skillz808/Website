# VoltorbFlip

This is an online recreation of the Voltorb Flip game that appeared in the Game 
Corner in Korean and Western releases of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. 
As an avid Pokémon fan who enjoys puzzle games, I decided to recreate the 
minigame for the web as a way to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I developed this using Google Chrome to check my progress, and as a result am 
unsure how it runs in other browsers. If you experience problems running this
please leave a report in the issues tab. I am by no means an expert web developer 
and am absolutely open to any feedback about my creation.

The current version on the website is not complete, as I plan to include the memo
pad and support for keyboard play in a future update. However, the current game
is fully functional and supports normal play from levels 1-7. Enjoy!
